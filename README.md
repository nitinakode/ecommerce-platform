# E-Commerce Web Application

A simple and responsive e-commerce web application built using React and React-Bootstrap. This application allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, apply promo codes, and place orders. The data is fetched from a fake API, and the app uses `localStorage` for storing the cart and order history.

## Features

- **Product Listings:** Browse products by category and search for items by name.
- **Product Details:** View detailed information about each product.
- **Cart Functionality:** Add products to the cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- **Promo Code:** Apply promo codes to get discounts on the total order.
- **Order History:** View a history of orders placed with timestamps and total amounts.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile views.

## Features in Detail

### Product Listings

On the homepage, users can view products, search by product title, and sort products by price or popularity. Each product is displayed in a card with the option to add it to the cart.

### Cart Functionality

The cart allows users to:
- View items added to the cart.
- Update quantities of items.
- Remove items from the cart.
- View the total cost and apply promo codes for discounts.

### Promo Code

Users can enter a promo code on the Cart page to get a discount on their order. Valid promo codes are `23`, `45`, `78`, and `99`. Each code corresponds to a fixed discount value.

### Order History

Once an order is placed, it is stored in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`. Users can view their order history, including item details and total amounts.

## Technologies Used

- **localStorage:** For storing the cart and order history in the browser.

## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication:** Add user login and registration to personalize the experience.
- **Backend Integration:** Integrate with a real backend for user management, products, and orders.
- **Payment Integration:** Implement a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for order checkout.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve error handling and loading states across the app.
